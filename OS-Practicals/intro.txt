Hey, My name is Nabhag, I am into backend software engineering and have a keen interest in building backend applications, currently in my pre-final year pursuing a bachelor’s in Computer Engineering from Charotar University of Science and Technology, Gujarat State, India. Involvement in global communities since my freshman year realised me it’s all about collaboration. With the community, we grow at an exponential rate.Before there was a vast gap for me to deal with the newest technologies and cope with the latest software development practices, been learning things but had no output. There are a lot of software engineering aspects that are not possible without communities. Sharing my learning is something I love doing. My hobby is answering questions on Stack Overflow and Twitter. I have been learning in public for the past 8 months, following the #100daysofcode. Meeting like-minded folks via challenge has been the best thing to happen. Believe in striving for code, which involves the best practices. I conducted a full-fledged programming challenge on the HackerEarth Platform and about 120+ of folks have taken part, of which 79 folks have used 100% of the completion time, which I am proud of. Instructing folks is something which I enjoy doing and would like to share my most recent teaching experience. My friend was developing an application and was attempting to set an HTTP cookie. While helping him, again realised that in our local community, folks have the knowledge, but there is a gap between how it works and the theoretical aspect. This is one reason that drives me to form a local community and want to give back to the community

Thank you!
